OpenPTV-Python (PyPTV)
======================

**OpenPTV-Python** (a.k.a **PyPTV**) is the Python version of [OpenPTV](http://www.openptv.net). It is basically the Python Traits GUI (from Enthought Inc.) that *interfaces* the OpenPTV library that includes all the core algorithms (correspondence, tracking, calibration, etc.) written in ANSI C. 

Both PyPTV and the OpenPTV library are in the development phase and continuously refactored. Please follow the development on the community mailing list:
