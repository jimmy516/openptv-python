Post Processing
====================

PostPTV
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Download it from <https://github.com/yosefm/postptv/tree/ptvis_mem> 

extract it somewhere. You only run the python from that directory of postptv and change the path to your files. All the data is included in the 'trajects' structure. 



Using the following few lines::

	from matplotlib import pyplot
	from flowtracks.io import trajectories_ptvis
	
	inName = '../PTV/ptv_is.%d'
	trajects = trajectories_ptvis(inName, traj_min_len=5) # the directory with the input files

	pyplot.figure(figsize = (12, 10))

	positions = [tr.pos() for tr in trajects]
	for pos in positions:
	trajX = [pos[k][0] for k in range(len(pos))]
	trajY = [pos[k][1] for k in range(len(pos))]
	pyplot.plot(trajX, trajY, '.')

	pyplot.legend()
	pyplot.show()


Using this on the test file, You would get the sparse image as the following:

|image1|

.. |image1| image:: ../images/fig20.png
